## Welcome to TEDxSoftdev Shell Scripting

### What is a Shell Script?

- A shell script is a program to be run by a shell.  
- A shell is a command line interpreter. 
- Steve Bourne created the first shell for Unix.

### Hsitory of Unix Shells

- First shell was made by Ken Thompson in 1971.
- Steve Bourne made the Bourne Shell in 1977.
- Goals to interactively execute commands and writing reusable scripts.

### Bash

- Bourne-Again Shell made to replace the Bourne Shell.
- Improvements such as command history, command-line editing, and job control (pausing and resuming processes).

### Running a Shell Script

- To run a .sh file, you must make the file executable using chmod +x  
- No need to compile separately as the language is written for the shell to understand

### Hello World

Code:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sadid-E/ShellScripting/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
